# Named Entity Recognition (NER)

Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) task that involves identifying and classifying entities in text into predefined categories such as names of people, organizations, locations, dates, and more. NER is crucial for extracting structured information from unstructured text data and is widely used in various applications like information retrieval, knowledge extraction, and text mining.

## How It Works
Text Processing: The process begins with raw text data. The text is tokenized into words or phrases to be analyzed.
Entity Identification: The model scans the text to identify potential entities. This involves detecting sequences of words that could represent entities like names, locations, dates, etc.
Entity Classification: Once potential entities are identified, the model classifies them into categories such as:

 - Person: Names of individuals (e.g., "John Doe")
 - Organization: Names of companies or institutions (e.g., "Google Inc.")
 - Location: Names of places (e.g., "New York City")
 - Date: Specific dates (e.g., "January 1, 2024")

Contextual Understanding: Modern NER systems use advanced techniques such as Bidirectional LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks with Attention mechanisms to understand the context of each word, improving the accuracy of entity classification.

Output: The result is a structured representation of the text with entities labeled and categorized, which can be used for further processing or analysis.

# Applications
 - Information Extraction: Automatically extract relevant information from large volumes of text.
 - Text Classification: Enhance text classification systems by understanding the entities mentioned.
 - Search Engines: Improve search relevance by recognizing entities within queries.
 - Chatbots and Virtual Assistants: Enable these systems to understand and respond to user queries based on recognized entities.
